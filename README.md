## What is ASP.NET Core?

ASP.NET Core open-source and cross-platform framework for building apps.

Things that we can use:

- Build web apps
- Internet of Things (IoT) apps
- Real-Time apps
- API
- Testing
- Deploy to cloud services.

## Why choose ASP.NET Core?

```
-  ASP.NET Core is a redesign of ASP.NET 4.x
-  ASP.NET 4.x build for windows but ASP.NET Core build for windows, macOS or Linux.
- Better performance compare to ASP.NET 4.x
- VSC or VS that can run many OS.

```

## .NET 5 vs .NET Framework

```
- .NET 5 and .NET Framework both can build server-side apps
- We use .NET 5 because it can run on many OS, works well with other microservices, 
smaller image size for creating & deploying a container because it is cross-platform, 
.NET 5 (or .NET Core 2.1 or 3.1) also allow each machine to have different versions 
but .NET Framework doesn't have this feature.
- Even though .NET 5 is a lot better than .NET Framework, but .NET Framework is more mature, 
there are a lot of packages OR libraries available for .NET Framework than .NET 5 
(ex. ASP.NET Web Forms, ASP.NET Web Pages, WCF, etc.)
As well as some third party or Microsoft services that are not all support .NET 5.
